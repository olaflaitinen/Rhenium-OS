## Overview

Rhenium OS is developed by Skolyn's multidisciplinary teams spanning AI research, machine learning engineering, medical data analysis, and product design. The platform integrates MedGemma-based reasoning with proprietary deep learning models including GANs, PINNs, U-Nets, and Vision Transformers to deliver state-of-the-art diagnostic imaging capabilities.

The team structure reflects the complexity of building a regulated, clinical-grade AI system:

- **Executive Leadership**: Strategic direction and AI vision
- **Artificial Intelligence Department**: Core model development and research (Teams 1 and 2)
- **AI Infrastructure**: DevOps and MLOps for training, deployment, and monitoring
- **Technology Department**: Core platform engineering and frontend development
- **Medical Data Analysis Team**: Clinical data curation, annotation, and validation
- **Product Department**: Product management, UX design, and clinical workflow integration
